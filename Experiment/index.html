      <p>The goal of this experiment is to compare how well you type using different types of keyboards and also to test out a protype typing hint system.</p>
      <p>None of the data collected will be published or shared with any parties, this is only for a graded class project.</p>
      <p>There are a total of 4 different trials, but the whole experiment should not take more than 15 minutes in total.</p>
